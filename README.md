# RSpec - Testing framework - where "R" = Ruby and "Spec" = "Specification"

+ Given some context
+ When some event occurs
+ Then I expect some outcome
+ Given ... When ... Then ...

RSpec uses a DSL (Domain Specific Language)
RSpec can be used to test Ruby and Rails applications.

User stories:
+ Description of the experience of a user of our software
+ Describe our goals
+ Excellent planning tool
+ Excellent communication tool with developers
+ Excellent communication tool with clients
+ Describes a single step in the user experience
  + Given... When... Then...

Example User Story #1
+ <b>Given</b> that a user is not logged in
+ <b>When</b> the user visits the login page
+ <b>Then</b> the user should see form fields for username and password and a submit button

Example User Story #2 - The "happy path"
+ <b>Given</b> that a user is not logged in
+ <b>When</b> the user enters a valid username and password and submits the form
+ <b>Then</b> the site should redirect them to an appropriate user page

Example User Story #3 - The "unhappy path"
+ <b>Given</b> that a user is not logged in
+ <b>When</b> the user enters a valid username and an invalid password and submits the form
+ <b>Then</b> the site should return a generic "not valid" error message and re-display the login form along with a "I am not a robot" field to prevent spamming

Example User Story #4 - The "unhappy path"
+ <b>Given</b> that a user is not logged in
+ <b>When</b> the user enters a an invalid username and a valid password and submits the form
+ <b>Then</b> the site should return a generic "not valid" error message and re-display the login form along with a "I am not a robot" field to prevent spamming

Example User Story #5 - Edge case (invalid credit card number or other missing or invalid fields)
+ <b>Given</b> that a user is not logged in and is viewing the login form
+ <b>When</b> the user leaves the form's username field blank and submits the form
+ <b>Then</b> the site should return a "username is cannot be blank" error message and re-display the login form

General Test Advice
+ Test should always be maintained and provide good coverage
+ Keep test suite fast so that you can run it more frequently
+ Make sure all tests pass before a commit is performed
+ Avoid brittle - tightly coupled tests - i.e. based on features not on implementation.
