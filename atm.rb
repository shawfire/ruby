# Trent Example lesson: 20170221 Tuesday
#
# Problem:
#   I'll be in the street ans I realise I need to withdraw $100 from an atm.
#
# What are the classes: street, atm (hidden class account)
# withdraw is an verb
#
# What attributes?
# What is/does initialize do?
# How do we create an instance of the class Atm?
# Approach when solving a problem:
#   How do I think to get to here... It's ok not to know.
#   Google is your friend. Know how to ask questions and find answers.
#   Try first. Then refactor/improve.
# Keep it simple and leave out the pin etc at the moment.
#
# Challenge:
#   Extend Atm so you can extend to disposit cash...?
#
# Personal challenge
#   Provide unit testing:
#      export PATH="/Users/shawfire/.local/bin:$PATH"
#      where /Users/shawfire/ is my home (~) directory
#      sudo gem install rubydoctest
#      rubydoctest atm.rb

class Atm

  # An atm has ... ?

  def initialize(location:, current_balance:)
    @location = location
    @current_balance = current_balance
  end

  # An atm can ... ?

  # An Atm can despense cash and a Person can withdraw cash
  #
  # >> melb_atm = Atm.new("Melbourne", 10000)
  # >> melb_atm.location
  # => "Melbourne"
  # >> melb_atm.current_balance
  # => 10000
  # >> melb_atm.dispense(50)
  # => 9950
  # >> melb_atm.current_balance
  # => 9950
  def dispense(amount)
    if @current_balance > amount
      @current_balance = @current_balance - amount
    else
      puts "Not enough money in Atm..."
    end
  end


  # An Atm can take cash and a Person can deposit cash
  #
  # >> melb_atm = Atm.new("Melbourne", 10000)
  # >> melb_atm.current_balance
  # => 10000
  # >> melb_atm.take(50)
  # => 10050
  # >> melb_atm.current_balance
  # => 10050
  def take(amount)
    #TODO assume there is enough space for the deposit
    @current_balance = @current_balance + amount
  end

  # Do we want all attributes to have a getter and a setter?
  # for example setting the balance could be dangerous.

  attr_accessor :location

  # Only allow read access unless we use dispense or intake

# Iterative testing
