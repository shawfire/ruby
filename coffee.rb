# John wants to buy a coffee from his local cafe.
# He likes to dring 3/4 latter's with 1 sugar.

# PROBLEM: Trent needs a coffee

# SOLUTION: If the cafe serves 3/4 lattes it will dispense it to me when asked.

# second_tier challenge.

# it tells me how much it is, requires me to
# input that into the terminal before it will serve me.

# classes
#   John attributes: name, preference, allergies
#   Cafe: location, menu
#   Menu:

# Personal Challenge:
#   Use TDD/BDD to unit/feature test Cafe and Customer
#     to allow the Customer to order a Coffee (i.e. caffee_test.rb)
#   Test the edge case where the Coffee ardered is not make by this Cafe.
